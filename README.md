Piccolo Tryout

A super simple piccolo admin app based off the playground example

I still like what I'm attempting to do with based better for structuring an API

Because I like having greater control over my API interface

I'm interested in some of how they are setting up their routes, as I'm not really happy with
how I'm doing that right now.  But, I don't like how they are doing it either.

There also some interesting ideas in how they are doing their passing of configuration data
to their admin page.  But, there is also plenty I would want to do differently.

That being said, if the PiccoloCrud was structured differently to allow query passthroughs I'd
just use it because it would be enough of what I want, and getting it to work with pydantic the way
I like wouldnt be too difficult

That being said, this is great for folks that just want a simple and modern api with an admin
interface.
